WordCamp Hamburg 2014 - Session Plan Planner
============================================

This is a simple Planning tool to plan which sessions one should / can attend.
It saves to JS localStorage so that it'll be available on the go, while at the WordCamp for example ;)

ToDo
====

- Fix bug with workshops and resetting next line
- Allow Sharing of Sessions (via hashed url which saves to localstorage and redirects)
- Add Manifest
- Host on github
